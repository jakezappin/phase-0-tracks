# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # Create hash data structure.
  # Split the string into seperate items.
  # Add items to the hash structure.
  # loop through and set default quantity
  # print the list to the console using the print method
# output: a hash table 

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: item name and optional quantity
# steps: loop through the list to see if item is already included in hash structure
  
 # IF it is
 	# Add the quantity of the item to the default quantity
 # Else
 	# Add the item and quantity
 # End

# print the list to console using the print method
# output: a hash table including the new item 

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: item name and optional quantity
# steps: loop through the hash table to see if the item is present 

 # IF the key is equal to the item name
 	# reduce quantity value from the key item 
 	# ELSE 
 	# print an error message
 # End

# print the list to console using the print method
# output: a hash table 

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: item name and optional quantity 
# steps: loop through the hash table to see if the item is present 

 # IF the key is equal to the item name
 	# add value to the quantity
 # ELSE
 	# print an error message
 # End

# print the list to console using the print method
# output: a hash table with the new value included

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: the hash table name
# steps: loop through and print out key value pairs
# output: a hash table with all the key value pairs
